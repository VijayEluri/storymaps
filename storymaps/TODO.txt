StoryEditor:
        
+    Things are starting to get messy, some refactoring of the 
     drag-drop protocol and/or the StoryMaps classes is needed.
     See the FIXME in StoryMap.dropped_onto.
     
+    StoryMap and StoryEditor need to support the concept of a 
     selected story card, and need to keep their selected card in
     sync.

Main things:

*   Implement saving and loading of stories, using Memento pattern as in Panda.
*   Implement text export of story documents.
*   Build as an executable jar file and as an applet.

Swing:

*   Should replace menubar with a toolbar (big icons with text under them) with
    New, Save, Load, Help, About and Quit buttons.

Drag & Drop:

*    Need to make sure that when dropped, a dragged node appears on top of the
     node it was dropped on, reparent it to the droppee and call moveToFront().

StoryCard:

*   Animated scaling
*   Fix enabling & disabling of story cards (image transparency)
*   Changing levels of detail
*   Show a text icon on StoryCard when it has some user text associated with it.

StoryMap:

*   If you drag a story card and drop it onto another story card in the story
    map, the drop should be accepted as normal. (Right now I think the droppable
    is not found by the drag-drop system because the story card is in the way.)
    
Other:

*   Change the mouse cursor when over a story card or when dragging a story card
    over a story map?
    
*   The zoom out needs to zoom out a little further. Implement home node as a
    decorator node with padding? Or just zoom further.

*   Piccolo camera should zoom to show only the user's story map when document
    editor is uncollapsed, when document editor is collapsed piccolo camera
    shows story cards and story map.
