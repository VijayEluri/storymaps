StoryCard:

*   Animated scaling
*   Enabling & disabling of story cards
*   Duplicating of story cards
*   Changing levels of detail

StoryMap:

*   Dragging a card from top story map to bottom should duplicate the card and
    add the duplicate to the bottom story map, original should snap back to
    where it was and become disabled. Perhaps the duplicate should be made on
    drag start and dragged instead of the original, which could be disabled on
    drag start.
*   Highlight when mouse-over
*   Refactoring

Other:

*   The zoom out needs to zoom out a little further. Implement home node as a
    decorator node with padding? Or just zoom further.
*   Transparent overlay text messages (in Piccolo this would be implemented
    using a sticky node)    
*   Saving and loading of stories

Swing document editor:

*   Scrolling document-editor pane, with a separate area for each function,
    functions displayed on left, text editors on right
*   As functions are added to and removed from the StoryMap they are added to
    and removed from the document editor
*   Document editor jumps to selected card in story map
*   Piccolo camera should zoom to show only the user's story map when document
    editor is uncollapsed, when document editor is collapsed piccolo camera
    shows story cards and story map.
