StoryCard:

*   Animated scaling
*   Fix enabling & disabling of story cards (image transparency)
*   Changing levels of detail

StoryMap:

*   Dragging a card from top story map to bottom should duplicate the card and
    add the duplicate to the bottom story map, original should snap back to
    where it was and become disabled. Perhaps the duplicate should be made on
    drag start and dragged instead of the original, which could be disabled on
    drag start.
*   Highlight when mouse-over
*   Refactoring

Other:

*   There should be exactly one instance of each card, and the user text written
    for that function should be stored with the card. If the card is in the
    story map or in the bank, the same instance is passed between the two story
    maps and retains its user text. Only a disabled copy is left in the story
    bank.

*   Move over the functions xml file and images from panda code, add a Functions
    class that parses it all and returns a list of Function objects. Have
    StoryMap read this list and create StoryCards to fill itself with.
*   The zoom out needs to zoom out a little further. Implement home node as a
    decorator node with padding? Or just zoom further.
*   Transparent overlay text messages (in Piccolo this would be implemented
    using a sticky node)    
*   Saving and loading of stories

Swing document editor:

*   Embed the PCanvas in a Swing GUI.
*   Scrolling document-editor pane, with a separate area for each function,
    functions displayed on left, text editors on right
*   As functions are added to and removed from the StoryMap they are added to
    and removed from the document editor
*   Document editor jumps to selected card in story map
*   Piccolo camera should zoom to show only the user's story map when document
    editor is uncollapsed, when document editor is collapsed piccolo camera
    shows story cards and story map.
