StoryCard:

*   Animated scaling
*   Fix enabling & disabling of story cards (image transparency)
*   Changing levels of detail
*   User text should be stored with StoryCard object. Show a text icon on
    StoryCard when it has some user text associated with it.

StoryMap:

*   Write the PlaceHolder class, simple PPath rect background like StoryCard,
    but doesn't need the other stuff that StoryCard has. Have a boolean `taken`
    field, use that instead of offset to find not-taken placeholders.

*   Highlight when mouse over?
    
Other:

*   Change the mouse cursor when over a story card or when dragging a story card
    over a story map?
    
*   Change the controls: left-click to drag, double-left-click to zoom,
    right-click to zoom out.

*   Move over the functions xml file and images from panda code, add a Functions
    class that parses it all and returns a list of Function objects. Have
    StoryMap read this list and create StoryCards to fill itself with.

*   The zoom out needs to zoom out a little further. Implement home node as a
    decorator node with padding? Or just zoom further.

*   Transparent overlay text messages (in Piccolo this would be implemented
    using a sticky node)    

*   Saving and loading of stories

Swing document editor:

*   Embed the PCanvas in a Swing GUI.

*   Scrolling document-editor pane, with a separate area for each function,
    functions displayed on left, text editors on right

*   As functions are added to and removed from the StoryMap they are added to
    and removed from the document editor

*   Document editor jumps to selected card in story map

*   Piccolo camera should zoom to show only the user's story map when document
    editor is uncollapsed, when document editor is collapsed piccolo camera
    shows story cards and story map.
