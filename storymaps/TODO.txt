StoryCard:

*   <del>Display title, image and descriptions</del>
*   <del>Scale when mouse-over</del>
*   Make scaling animated
*   <del>Zoom to when clicked on</del>
*   Drag & drop, perhaps onto a highlighting target
*   Changing levels of detail

StoryMap:

*   A StoryMap object should compose a variable number of StoryCard objects and
    arrange them into a grid formation. Have a single empty PNode be the
    parent node of all the StoryCard nodes, and act as a layout node.
*   Should also have an editable title above the cards
*   Should be possible to have the StoryMap node itself visible as a coloured
    rectangle behind the StoryCards, user can drop a StoryCard onto the
    StoryMap, and it will be grabbed by the StoryMap and snapped to the nearest
    grid position.

Other:

*   Implement home node as an empty PNode that is the parent of all other nodes,
    and implement zooming out to this node.
*   Transparent overlay text messages    
*   Saving and loading of stories

Swing document editor:

*   Implement a scrolling text-editor pane, with a separate area for each
    function, functions displayed on left, text on right.
*   As functions are added to and removed from the StoryMap they are added to
    and removed from the document editor
*   Document editor jumps to selected card in story map
*   Piccolo camera should zoom to show only the user's story map when document
    editor is uncollapsed, when document editor is collapsed piccolo camera
    shows story cards and story map.
