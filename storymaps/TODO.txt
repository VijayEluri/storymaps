High Priority
-------------

*   Implement saving and loading of stories, using Memento pattern as in Panda.
*   Implement text export of story documents.
*   Build as an executable jar file and as an applet.
*   Replace menubar with a toolbar with New, Save, Load, Help, About and Quit
    buttons.
*   Changing levels of detail on story cards.
*   Show a text icon on StoryCard when it has some user text associated with it.

Low Priority
------------

StoryEditor:
             
+   StoryMap and StoryEditor need to support the concept of a selected story
    card. The selected card should be kept in sync between the StoryMap and the
    StoryEditor. The selected card should be highlighted somehow in both
    (Decorator node?). In StoryEditor the selected card should be scrolled to
    and focused (nasty bug here). Zooming in on a StoryCard in the StoryMap
    should make it selected.

+   Things are starting to get messy, some refactoring of the 
    drag-drop protocol and/or the StoryMaps classes is needed.
    See the FIXME in StoryMap.dropped_onto.

+   Unit tests.

Drag & Drop:

*    Need to make sure that when dropped, a dragged node appears on top of the
     node it was dropped on, reparent it to the droppee and call moveToFront().

StoryCard:

*   Animated scaling
*   Fix enabling & disabling of story cards (image transparency)

StoryMap:

*   If you drag a story card and drop it onto another story card in the story
    map, the drop should be accepted as normal. (Right now I think the droppable
    is not found by the drag-drop system because the story card is in the way.)
    
Other:

*   Change the mouse cursor when over a story card or when dragging a story card
    over a story map?
    
*   The zoom out needs to zoom out a little further. Implement home node as a
    decorator node with padding? Or just zoom further.

*   Piccolo camera should zoom to show only the user's story map when document
    editor is uncollapsed, when document editor is collapsed piccolo camera
    shows story cards and story map.
