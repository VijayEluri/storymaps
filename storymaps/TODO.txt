High Priority
-------------

*   File selector dialogs for save and restore.
*   Implement text export of story documents. Do this by adding toString()
    methods to all the memento objects.
*   Build as an executable jar file and as an applet.
    NetBeans already builds it as a jar file, but it can't find any of the
    images or other data files.

*   Changing levels of detail on story cards.
*   Show a text icon on StoryCard when it has some user text associated with it.
*   If you drag a story card and drop it onto another story card in the story
    map, the drop should be accepted as normal. (Right now I think the droppable
    is not found by the drag-drop system because the story card is in the way.)
    To implement this StoryCard will have to implement Droppable, and use the
    Messager to pass the message on up to the StoryMap. Or the drag-drop
    protocol could search up the scene graph until it finds a node with a 
    Droppable attribute, instead of just looking at the first pickable node that
    is not the draggee.

Low Priority
------------

StoryEditor:
             
+   Make StoryMap highlight the currently selected StoryCard, the one that is
    focused in StoryEditor. If the user changes the focus in StoryEditor,
    StoryMap should respond. This is going to require changing the relationship
    between StoryMap and StoryEditor, instead of StoryMap holding a reference to
    StoryEditor or vice-versa they need two-way communication.
        
+   Unit tests.

Drag & Drop:

*    Need to make sure that when dropped, a dragged node appears on top of the
     node it was dropped on, reparent it to the droppee and call moveToFront().

StoryCard:

*   Animated scaling
*   Fix image transparency problem on disabled story cards.
    
Other:

*   Change the mouse cursor when over a story card or when dragging a story card
    over a story map?
    
*   The zoom out needs to zoom out a little further. Implement home node as a
    decorator node with padding? Or just zoom further.

*   Piccolo camera should zoom to show only the user's story map when document
    editor is uncollapsed, when document editor is collapsed piccolo camera
    shows story cards and story map.
    
Refactoring
-----------

*   Quite a lot of duplicated code between StoryMap and StoryCards. Do this by
    moving code into StoryBase. Will require use of a common interface of 
    Placeholder and DisabledStoryCard.

*   Commit unit tests into git.

*   StoryCard should not have a disabled field and enable and disable
    methods. Instead, DisabledStoryCard should be a subclass of StoryCard. The 
    code will be simpler, and it will be closer to how StoryCard is actually
    used.

*   FunctionEditor shouldn't need to keep a reference to a Function. Is this
    being made use of anywhere? StoryCard should just pass the image URL to the
    FunctionEditor constructor instead, FunctionEditor doesn't know what
    function it represents, but StoryCard does.
