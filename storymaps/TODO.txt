Drag & Drop:

*    Need to make sure that when dropped, a dragged node appears on top of the
     node it was dropped on, reparent it to the droppee and call moveToFront().

StoryCard:

*   Animated scaling
*   Fix enabling & disabling of story cards (image transparency)
*   Changing levels of detail
*   User text should be stored with StoryCard object. Show a text icon on
    StoryCard when it has some user text associated with it.

StoryMap:

*   If you drag a story card and drop it onto another story card in the story
    map, the drop should be accepted as normal. (Right now I think the droppable
    is not found by the drag-drop system because the story card is in the way.)
    
Other:

*   Change the mouse cursor when over a story card or when dragging a story card
    over a story map?
    
*   The zoom out needs to zoom out a little further. Implement home node as a
    decorator node with padding? Or just zoom further.

*   Transparent overlay text messages (in Piccolo this would be implemented
    using a sticky node).

*   Saving and loading of stories

Swing document editor:

*   Embed the PCanvas in a Swing GUI.

*   Scrolling document-editor pane, with a separate area for each function,
    functions displayed on left, text editors on right

*   As functions are added to and removed from the StoryMap they are added to
    and removed from the document editor

*   Document editor jumps to selected card in story map

*   Piccolo camera should zoom to show only the user's story map when document
    editor is uncollapsed, when document editor is collapsed piccolo camera
    shows story cards and story map.
