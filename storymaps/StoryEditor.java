/*
 * StoryEditor should be a Container containing a variable number of JLabel and
 * JEditorPane pairs (the JLabel containing the label for a function, and the
 * editor being for the user text for the fuction) with the correct layouts,
 * and methods for adding and removing functions.
 * 
 * Hiding and unhiding the StoryEditor will be handled higher up, either by a
 * JSplitPane or with a JButton and my own hide/unhide code.
 * 
 * StoryEditor should have its own main method that opens up a JFrame and sets
 * the StoryEditor Container as the content pane of that JFrame, and loads a
 * few functions, maybe put menu items or buttons on the JFrame to add and
 * remove functions, in other words its own test suite.
