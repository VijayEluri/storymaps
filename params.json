With StoryMaps children\r\ncan create stories that contain their own original ideas while being\r\nstructurally complete and well-formed. I hope that StoryMaps will give children\r\na powerful mental model for understanding stories and their construction.\r\nSchool trials of StoryMaps found that through using the application children\r\nwere able to grasp abstract narrative concepts and apply them to their own\r\nwriting, and that the experience improved the narrative structure of children's\r\nstories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can read more about StoryMaps, the ideas behind\r\nit and how it was developed and evaluated with teachers and children in these\r\npublications:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><p>\r\n    <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1842/3533\">Children's Story Authoring with Propp's Morphology</a><br>\r\n    (<a href=\"presentation/\">accompanying presentation)</a><br>\r\n    Sean Hammond, PhD thesis, The University of Edinburgh 2010\r\n  </p></li>\r\n  <li><p>\r\n    <a href=\"NILE2008paper.pdf\">Children's Story Authoring with Propp's Morphology: An Exploratory Study</a>,<br>\r\n    (<a href=\"NILE2008presentation.pdf\">accompanying presentation</a>, <a href=\"NILE2008_with_notes.pdf\">with notes</a>)<br>\r\n    Sean Hammond, Tim J.
