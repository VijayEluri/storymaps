### Introduction

Slide: Title Slide
:	Introduce myself.

Slide: Story Maps
:	For my PhD I designed, implemented and evaluated a story authoring
	tool for children.

Slide: Propp's Morphology
:	The tool is based on Propp's classic model of fairy tale narrative
	structure, _Propp's morphology_.

Slide: Story Writing Session
:	I evaluated the tool in usability studies with children and
	teachers, and in empirical studies of children's story writing in
	schools.  
	I found that children were able to use the tool to plan and write
	their own original stories.

Slide: Results
:	Through using the Story Maps application children were able to grasp
	abstract narrative concepts and apply them to their own writing;
	using the application improved some aspects of children's stories;
	and children reported that they enjoyed using the application and
	found that it was helpful to their story writing.
	
	Feedback from the children suggests that they enjoyed using the tool
	to write stories and found it helpful, that they felt a greater
	sense of creative freedom and ownership over their stories, and that
	the tool gave them confidence in the quality of their stories.

### Motivation

Slide: Outline
:	...

Slide: Riley & Reedy
Slide: A Woodlouse's Adventure
Slide: The Little Flower
:	These are typical classroom story-planning worksheets.
	TODO: Limitations of these.

Slide: Adventure Author
Slide: Script Cards
:	These are existing 'interactive narrative' computer applications.
	TODO: What's missing from these.

TODO: slide about beginning, middle & end; conflict & resolution; clear
and consistent roles; motivations.

Slide: Perrault's The Fairies (1)
Slide: Perrault's The Fairies (2)
Slide: Perrault's The Fairies (3)
Slide: Perrault's The Fairies (4)
:	This story is given as an example of what I mean by fairy tale
	narrative structure.

	*	There are logical relationships between the events in the tale,
		each event has a role to play in the tale as a whole and each
		event articulates precisely with the other events in the tale:
		being sent to the well enables the youngest daughter to meet the
		poor woman, which enables the poor woman to test the daughter,
		which enables her to respond, and so on.

	*	There are aesthetic relations, patterned contrastive repetitions
		at multiple levels: the good young daughter goes to the well and
		returns with the gift of flowers and jewels, the evil daughter
		goes the well and returns with the curse of snakes and toads.

	*	There is a moral order encoded in the structure of the tale: the
		essential goodness of the younger daughter is rewarded, the
		essential wickedness of the elder daugher is punished.

	These are medium-independent, they are features or narrative itself,
	rather than features of interactive narrative as a medium.

	So what we want is a high-level model of narrative that embodies
	knowledge about the overall structure of a narrative and the purpose
	of components such as characters, actions and motivations within the
	whole.

### Propp's Morphology

Slide: Outline
:	This thesis proposes that _Propp's morphology_ is a suitable model.

Slide: Vladimir Propp
:	Propp was a Russian folklorist who in the early 20th century
	carried out a study of the narrative structures of traditional
	Russian fairy tales.

Slide: Afanasyev
:	Propp studied thousands of fairy tales from Afanasyev's collection
	of Russian folk tales.

Slide: Morphology of the Folktale
:	Propp presented the results of his study in his book _Morphology of
	the Folktale_.

	In _Morphology_ Propp aimed to decompose tales into their component
	parts and study the relationsips of these components to each other
	and to the whole. The result was an abstract structural composition
	or "morphology" that Propp claims underlies the type of tales that
	he studied.

Slide: Propp's Functions (1)
:	Propp breaks down tales into units that he calls "functions".
	This is an example of one of Propp's functions, _Arrival_.
	This one function appears in many different forms in many different
	tales. All of the concrete details: the characters, the objects, the
	locations, and the ways in which the function is realised, change
	from one tale to the next. But the function always remains the same.

Slide: Propp's Functions (2)
:	Propp defined a function as _an act of a character, defined from the
	point of view of its significance for the course of action_.

Slide: Propp's Functions (3)
:	Propp identified 31 functions that he claimed accounted for the
	plots of thousands of Russian fairy tales.
	
	Not every story contains every function, the functions always occur
	in the same order, no function excludes another.

Slide: Propp's Functions (4)
:	While all of the concrete details of the fairy tales vary widely,
	the functions are remarkably consistent.

	"This explains the two-fold quality of the tale: its amazing
	multiformity, picturesqueness, and color, and on the other hand, its
	no less striking uniformity, its repetition."

Slide: Propp's Functions (5)
:	What I've investigated in my thesis is the application of Propp's
	morphology as a story construction kit, to be used by children to
	plan and write their own original stories that display the true
	fairy tale form, that are structurally complete and well-formed.

	You construct a story by choosing what functions you want and then
	filling in the details.
	-	You can plan the whole thing first and then write it.
	-	Or you can be more spontaneous, selecting some elements and
		writing that part of your story, then picking some more elements
		and filling in those.
	-	Teachers can vary  the components that are available to choose
		from, beginning with just a few of the basic components, and
		building up to a much richer model of narrative with a large
		number of components and with several different types of
		component representing differetn narrative concepts.

	*	Propp's morphology embodies the fairy tale narrative structure:
		-	The beginning, middle and end
		-	The conflict and resolution
		-	The character roles and motivations
		-	The logical, aesthetic and moral relationships and patterns
	*	Children get to actively construct the narrative structure of
		the story and fill in the concrete details themselves.
	*	So they will feel ownership over their stories, rather than
		feeling like they are being told what to write about.
	*	The fairy tale components might assist children with ideas for
		their stories: both in generating ideas and in realising the
		ideas that children bring to it. Each function represents a
		section of the fairy tale world, and is full of meaning.
	*	It is open to personalisation.
	*	The fairy tale structure appeals to the child's experience of
		the world: prohibitions, missions and duels, difficult tests and
		disappointments, magical gifts and donors, powerful allies and
		diabolical enemies.
	*	It has cultural presence, in modern narratives that are popular
		with children.
	*	It is empowering, because it reveals powerful knowledge about
		narratives and how they are constructed.
	*	Through interacting with Propp's morphology, children may be
		able to appropriate the fairy tale narrative structure for
		themselves.

Slide: Thesis Questions
:	1.	How can Propp's morphology be represented in a story authoring
		tool for children?
	2.	Can children apply Propp's morphology to story writing?
	3.	Does using Propp's morphology affect the quality of the stories
		written by children? If so, in what ways?
	
	Children = 7-11 year-olds.

### Exploratory Study

Slide: Outline
:	...

Slide: Exploratory Study (1)
:	This was a two-week study in which children wrote stories using
	paper 'Propp cards' and 'story maps', an early prototype of the
	planned computer application.

	Wanted to verify that children could grasp Propp's morphology and
	its abstract narrative concepts, such as the concept of function,
	and that they could use it to write stories with Proppian narrative
	structures.

	Wanted to try out Propp cards and story maps as an interface.

	Wanted to get experience working with children and story writing.

Slide: A Propp Card
:	This is one of the Propp cards used in the study. In the top-left is
	the name of the Propp function, an illustration, and some
	instructions. The rest of the card is left blank for the participant
	to write that part of their story.

Slide: A Story Map
:	This is one of the story maps used in the study. It is a sequence of
	Propp cards, laid out on a table or board.

Slide: Research Question
:	Can children use Propp cards and story maps to write stories that
	realise the Proppian narrative structures that the Propp cards and
	story maps aim to represent?

Slide: Week One: Recasting
:	In the first week children created new stories from existing sample
	stories. They were read a sample Proppian tale, shown the story map
	for the sample tale, and were then asked to write their own stories
	following the same story map.

Slide: Week Two: Constructing
:	In the second week the same children returned, and this time they
	wrote stories following story maps that they constructed themselves
	by selecting which Propp cards they wanted to use.

Slide: Interpretation of Propp's Morphology
:	We had to develop a means of assessing the stories written by the
	participants to decide, in a consistent and reliable way, what
	sequence of Propp functions was realised by each story.
	
	These sequences could then be compared to the sequences of functions
	represented by the story maps used, to measure how successfully the
	participants had followed the story maps.

	For this purpose we developed a clear, consistent and concise
	interpretation of Propp's morphology and a procedure for analysing a
	story using the interpretation, deriving a sequence of Propp
	functions from the story.

Slide: Quantitative Results
:	The quantitative results showed that the children were able to
	follow the story maps with a high degree of accuracy.

Slide: Limitations
:	These quantitative results have some important limitations:

	They concern Propp's functions only, and do not take into account
	the many other components of Propp's morphology.

	They do not account for the originality of the stories, do not
	distinguish between highly creative applications of Propp's
	morphology and simple rewrites of the sample stories. Qualitative
	analysis of the stories is needed.

	They do not account for the quality of the stories, or compare
	stories written with and without using Propp's morphology.

	They do not measure learning, no comparison of stories written
	before and after using Propp's morphology. Did the children
	appropriate Proppian narrative concepts from their experience with
	the tool?

Slide: Thesis Questions
:	So at this point in the research, where are we with respect to the
	thesis questions?
	
	Q1.
	We have confirmed that Propp cards and story maps are a successful
	representation of Propp's morphology for a story authoring tool.
	These basic interface elements, along with observations about how
	the children used them and what worked and what didn't, can now
	feed into the design of a computer application that will further
	answer Q1.

	Q2.
	We have shown that children can apply Propp's morphology to story
	writing. They were able to grasp Propp's abstract narrative
	concepts, such as the concept of function, and apply these concepts
	to their own writing.

	Q3.
	We have not made much progress on Q3 yet, there has been no
	comparison of stories written with and without using Propp's
	morphology.

### The Story Maps Application

Slide: Outline
:	Story Maps is a computer story authoring application that I
	developed and evaluated for this PhD.
	
	Its design is based on the exploratory study:

	*	The interpretation of Propp's morphology
	*	The Propp cards and story maps
	*	Observations of children's interaction with the Propp cards and
		story maps, what worked and what didn't

	Requirements were drawn up, a prototype implemented and tested with
	teachers and children, and then the final version implemented and
	tested.

Slide: Planning View (1)
Slide: Planning View (2)
:	The planning view is the opening screen of Story Maps. You are
	presented with a collection of story cards to choose from in the
	green area at the top. You can inspect each card more closely by
	moving the mouse cursor over a card to see it in more detail. You
	drag-and-drop the story cards that you want to use and arrange them
	into a story map in the grey area below. You can enter a title for
	your story in the toolbar at the bottom of the window.

Slide: Propp Cards
:	Propp cards were created for each of Propp's functions.
	Child-friendly texts for the cards were created based on our
	interpretation of Propp and on feedback from teachers.
	Illustrations were created by designer and illustrator Raymond Yuen,
	based on the texts.

Slide: Zooming
:	Each card has a title, short description, and longer description,
	these are progressively revealed as the user 'zooms in' on the card.

Slide: Story Editor
:	Clicking on the _Write your Story!_ button brings up the story
	editor.  With your story map in view above, you use the text editor
	below to enter the text for your story. You have to fill in a part
	of your story for each story card in your story map. If you change
	your mind about one of the cards in your story map, you can go back
	to the planning view at any time by clicking the _Go back to
	planning_ button.

Slide: Saving & Opening
:	You can save your story map to file and open a saved story map to
	continue working on it later.

Slide: Export & Print
:	You can export your story to HTML or print it.

Slide: Logging
:	The application automatically saves your story and keeps a log.

Slide: Story Maps URL
:	Story Maps is cross-platform and free software, you can download it
	from the website: <seanh.github.com/storymaps>.

### Experimental Study

Slide: Outline
:	...

Slide: Experiment
:	...

Slide: Research Question
:	...

Slide: Hypotheses
:	The expectation was that using the story maps application would
	improve some aspects of the stories written but not other aspects:

	We expected the plot structure of the stories to improve. Story Maps
	should encourage stories to have a clear build up, precipitating
	event, protagonist's goal, action and resolution, because this plot
	structure is embedded in the Propp cards and their sequence.

	We expected character roles to improve. Story Maps should encourage
	stories to contain characters that act in clear and consistent
	roles, such as protagonist and antagonist, because these roles are
	embodied by the spheres of action contained in Propp's functions.

	We expected the coherence of the stories to improve, because the
	Propp cards embody a logically and artistically sound sequence and
	flow of events.

	We did _not_ expect the story maps application to affect the
	description of characters or settings and their attributes or of
	emotions because characters, settings and their attributes are not
	represented as first-class objects in the application.

Slide: Research Design
:	The study used a pre-test post-test with control group research
	design. Each participant wrote three stories during the study, at
	pre-test, control or treatment condition and post-test.

	For the pre-test all participants wrote stories using "crib sheet"
	that was created with the help of a teacher.

	Each participant was then randomly assigned to either the treatment
	group or the control group. Treatment group participants created
	stories using the story maps application, while the control group
	participants used a typical classroom story planner.

	Finally, all participants wrote a third story for post-test, using
	the same crib sheet as in the pre-test.

Slide: Pre-test
:	For the pre-test participants read a "crib sheet" of questions to
	keep in mind before writing their stories. On the back of the crib
	sheet were some story titles to help with ideas.

Slide: Treatment
:	For the treatment participants were given a 15-minute introduction
	to the story maps application and the narrative concepts it uses.
	They then used the application to plan their stories in the
	computers. Participants printed out their completed story maps, and
	used these to write their stories on paper.

Slide: Control
:	For the control condition participants planned their stories using a
	typical story planning framework, and then wrote them.

Slide: Post-test
:	The post-test was the same as the pre-test, but the suggested story
	titles on the back of the crib sheet were different.

Slide: Quantitative Measure of Narrative Structure
:	To analyse the stories a quantitative measure of narrative structure
	was developed using an independent set of stories written by
	children of the same age group.

	The construct of _narrative structure_ that was to be measured was
	defined, the available procedures and tools were reviewed, and an
	existing analytic rating scale was selected. This scale was trialed
	on an independent set of real-world data and problems were found, so
	the scale was significantly improved based on the trial data. An
	inter-rater reliability test of the improved scale was carried out,
	with good results.

	The measure contains 11 scales such as the one shown, each measuring
	a different criteria. It records whether or not the story has a
	protagonist and antagonist, major and minor settings, a
	precipitating event and some causal build-up to the precipitating
	event, whether the protagonist has a goal and initiates actions in
	order to achieve the goal, whether the story has a resolution, and a
	few further details. Each scale is simple and unidimensional, the
	levels are clearly defined, and empirical examples from the trial
	data exemplify each level.

	This scale can tell us both _whether_ and _in what ways_ two sets of
	stories differ; it is reasonably quick to apply and can be used by
	non-experts; it is reliable; it is valid (it ticks all of the boxes
	on our defined construct of narrative structure); and it is more
	sensitive than other available quantitative measures.

Slide: Quantitative Results
:	We found that the story maps application did improve the narrative
	structure of the stories in some of the ways that we expected, but
	for some aspects of narrative structure there was no room for
	improvement. Specifically, Story Maps increased the incidence of
	stories that contained an antagonist and increased the causal
	complexity of story events leading up to the precipitating event.

	But these conclusions must be qualified. First, due to an unexpected
	difference between the control and treatment groups _at pre-test_,
	the rival hypothesis of regression toward the mean cannot be
	strongly refuted on the basis of the quantitative data. Second,
	insufficient evidence was found to conclude that any effect was
	retained at post-test.

	As expected, we found no evidence that the story maps application
	affected descriptions or emotions in the stories.

Slide: Thesis Questions
:	Where does this leave is with respect to the thesis questions?

	1. The Story Maps application has been developed and tested in
	formative usability studies and in empirical studies of children's
	story authoring in school settings. The application is a successful
	representation of Propp's morphology in a story authoring tool for
	children.

	The Story Maps application has limitations, including a lack of
	support for descriptions of characters and settings, and that only
	the most fundamental concepts from Propp's morphology are
	represented.

	2. The exploratory and experimental studies show that children can
	apply Propp's morphology to story writing.

	Again, only the most basic concepts from Propp have been studied.

	3. The experimental study has compared stories written using a story
	authoring tool based on Propp's morphology to stories written using
	a typical story planner, and shown (with qualifications) that
	certain aspects of the narrative structures of the stories were
	improved.

	Further qualitative analysis could tell us more about the quality of
	the stories, and abut how children have used Propp's concepts in
	their stories.

### Further Work

Slide: Outline
:	...

Slide: Further Work (1)
:	Several areas for further work have been identified, including:

	Qualitative analysis of the stories, using Propp's morphology.
	Stories would first be broken down into their Proppian components,
	and then systematic description would proceed from this analysis.
	Children's stories could be compared to each other and to
	traditional tales. The aim is a rich description of _how_ children
	have made use of Propp's morphology in their stories, what they can
	do with it.

	Further formalisation of Propp's morphology.

	Integrating more of Propp's concepts into the Story Maps
	application, enriching the model of narrative structure embodied by
	the application.

	Longer-term study of children's acquisition of fairy-tale narrative
	structure through Propp's morphology. Both quantitative and
	qualitative analysis would be used. Pre-test post-test with control
	group, but with an intervention several sessions long. The aim is to
	show learning, to show a significant effect at post-test.

Slide: Further Work(2)
:	An agenda for further study could be as follows:

	Take one narrative concept from Propp's morphology at a time.

	Carry out formative studies to find out how to formalise the
	concept, and how to integrate it into a story authoring application.

	The result of these formative studies would be a new version of the
	story maps application with an additional narrative concept
	represented.

	This new version of the story authoring application could then be
	used in experimental studies of children's story authoring. Can
	children acquire the new narrative concept and apply it
	successfully? If so, how do they use the new concept in their
	stories?

	You would then take the next narrative concept from Propp's
	morphology and begin the cycle again.
