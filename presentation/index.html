<h3>Introduction</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Slide: Title Slide</dt>
<dd>Introduce myself.</dd>
<dt>Slide: Story Maps</dt>
<dd>For my PhD I designed, implemented and evaluated a story authoring
tool for children.</dd>
<dt>Slide: Propp's Morphology</dt>
<dd>The tool is based on Propp's classic model of fairy tale narrative
structure, <em>Propp's morphology</em>.</dd>
<dt>Slide: Story Writing Session</dt>
<dd>I evaluated the tool in usability studies with children and
teachers, and in empirical studies of children's story writing in
schools.<br>
I found that children were able to use the tool to plan and write
their own original stories.</dd>
<dt>Slide: Results</dt>
<dd>
<p>Through using the Story Maps application children were able to grasp
abstract narrative concepts and apply them to their own writing;
using the application improved some aspects of children's stories;
and children reported that they enjoyed using the application and
found that it was helpful to their story writing.</p>
<p>Feedback from the children suggests that they enjoyed using the tool
to write stories and found it helpful, that they felt a greater
sense of creative freedom and ownership over their stories, and that
the tool gave them confidence in the quality of their stories.</p>

<dd>
<p>This story is given as an example of what I mean by fairy tale
narrative structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are logical relationships between the events in the tale,
    each event has a role to play in the tale as a whole and each
    event articulates precisely with the other events in the tale:
    being sent to the well enables the youngest daughter to meet the
    poor woman, which enables the poor woman to test the daughter,
    which enables her to respond, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are aesthetic relations, patterned contrastive repetitions
    at multiple levels: the good young daughter goes to the well and
    returns with the gift of flowers and jewels, the evil daughter
    goes the well and returns with the curse of snakes and toads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a moral order encoded in the structure of the tale: the
    essential goodness of the younger daughter is rewarded, the
    essential wickedness of the elder daugher is punished.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are medium-independent, they are features or narrative itself,
rather than features of interactive narrative as a medium.</p>
<p>So what we want is a high-level model of narrative that embodies
knowledge about the overall structure of a narrative and the purpose
of components such as characters, actions and motivations within the
whole.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Propp's Morphology</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Slide: Outline</dt>
<dd>This thesis proposes that <em>Propp's morphology</em> is a suitable model.</dd>
<dt>Slide: Vladimir Propp</dt>
<dd>Propp was a Russian folklorist who in the early 20th century
carried out a study of the narrative structures of traditional
Russian fairy tales.</dd>
<dt>Slide: Afanasyev</dt>
<dd>Propp studied thousands of fairy tales from Afanasyev's collection
of Russian folk tales.</dd>
<dt>Slide: Morphology of the Folktale</dt>
<dd>
<p>Propp presented the results of his study in his book <em>Morphology of
the Folktale</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Morphology</em> Propp aimed to decompose tales into their component
parts and study the relationsips of these components to each other
and to the whole. The result was an abstract structural composition
or "morphology" that Propp claims underlies the type of tales that
he studied.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Propp's Functions (1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Propp breaks down tales into units that he calls "functions".
This is an example of one of Propp's functions, <em>Arrival</em>.
This one function appears in many different forms in many different
tales. All of the concrete details: the characters, the objects, the
locations, and the ways in which the function is realised, change
from one tale to the next. But the function always remains the same.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Propp's Functions (2)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Propp defined a function as <em>an act of a character, defined from the
point of view of its significance for the course of action</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Propp's Functions (3)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Propp identified 31 functions that he claimed accounted for the
plots of thousands of Russian fairy tales.</p>
<p>Not every story contains every function, the functions always occur
in the same order, no function excludes another.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Propp's Functions (4)</dt>
<dd>
<p>While all of the concrete details of the fairy tales vary widely,
the functions are remarkably consistent.</p>
<p>"This explains the two-fold quality of the tale: its amazing
multiformity, picturesqueness, and color, and on the other hand, its
no less striking uniformity, its repetition."</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Propp's Functions (5)</dt>
<dd>
<p>What I've investigated in my thesis is the application of Propp's
morphology as a story construction kit, to be used by children to
plan and write their own original stories that display the true
fairy tale form, that are structurally complete and well-formed.</p>
<p>You construct a story by choosing what functions you want and then
filling in the details.
-   You can plan the whole thing first and then write it.
-   Or you can be more spontaneous, selecting some elements and
    writing that part of your story, then picking some more elements
    and filling in those.
-   Teachers can vary  the components that are available to choose
    from, beginning with just a few of the basic components, and
    building up to a much richer model of narrative with a large
    number of components and with several different types of
    component representing differetn narrative concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Propp's morphology embodies the fairy tale narrative structure:<ul>
<li>The beginning, middle and end</li>
<li>The conflict and resolution</li>
<li>The character roles and motivations</li>
<li>The logical, aesthetic and moral relationships and patterns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Children get to actively construct the narrative structure of
    the story and fill in the concrete details themselves.</li>
<li>So they will feel ownership over their stories, rather than
    feeling like they are being told what to write about.</li>
<li>The fairy tale components might assist children with ideas for
    their stories: both in generating ideas and in realising the
    ideas that children bring to it. Each function represents a
    section of the fairy tale world, and is full of meaning.</li>
<li>It is open to personalisation.</li>
<li>The fairy tale structure appeals to the child's experience of
    the world: prohibitions, missions and duels, difficult tests and
    disappointments, magical gifts and donors, powerful allies and
    diabolical enemies.</li>
<li>It has cultural presence, in modern narratives that are popular
    with children.</li>
<li>It is empowering, because it reveals powerful knowledge about
    narratives and how they are constructed.</li>
<li>Through interacting with Propp's morphology, children may be
    able to appropriate the fairy tale narrative structure for
    themselves.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Thesis Questions</dt>

<ol>
<li>How can Propp's morphology be represented in a story authoring
    tool for children?</li>
<li>Can children apply Propp's morphology to story writing?</li>
<li>Does using Propp's morphology affect the quality of the stories
    written by children? If so, in what ways?</li>

<h3>Exploratory Study</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Slide: Outline</dt>
<dd>...</dd>
<dt>Slide: Exploratory Study (1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This was a two-week study in which children wrote stories using
paper 'Propp cards' and 'story maps', an early prototype of the
planned computer application.</p>
<p>Wanted to verify that children could grasp Propp's morphology and
its abstract narrative concepts, such as the concept of function,
and that they could use it to write stories with Proppian narrative
structures.</p>
<p>Wanted to try out Propp cards and story maps as an interface.</p>
<p>Wanted to get experience working with children and story writing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: A Propp Card</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is one of the Propp cards used in the study. In the top-left is
the name of the Propp function, an illustration, and some
instructions. The rest of the card is left blank for the participant
to write that part of their story.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: A Story Map</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is one of the story maps used in the study. It is a sequence of
Propp cards, laid out on a table or board.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Research Question</dt>
<dd>
<p>Can children use Propp cards and story maps to write stories that
realise the Proppian narrative structures that the Propp cards and
story maps aim to represent?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Week One: Recasting</dt>
<dd>
<p>In the first week children created new stories from existing sample
stories. They were read a sample Proppian tale, shown the story map
for the sample tale, and were then asked to write their own stories
following the same story map.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Week Two: Constructing</dt>
<dd>
<p>In the second week the same children returned, and this time they
wrote stories following story maps that they constructed themselves
by selecting which Propp cards they wanted to use.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Interpretation of Propp's Morphology</dt>
<dd>
<p>We had to develop a means of assessing the stories written by the
participants to decide, in a consistent and reliable way, what
sequence of Propp functions was realised by each story.</p>
<p>These sequences could then be compared to the sequences of functions
represented by the story maps used, to measure how successfully the
participants had followed the story maps.</p>
<p>For this purpose we developed a clear, consistent and concise
interpretation of Propp's morphology and a procedure for analysing a
story using the interpretation, deriving a sequence of Propp
functions from the story.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Quantitative Results</dt>
<dd>
<p>The quantitative results showed that the children were able to
follow the story maps with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Limitations</dt>
<dd>
<p>These quantitative results have some important limitations:</p>
<p>They concern Propp's functions only, and do not take into account
the many other components of Propp's morphology.</p>
<p>They do not account for the originality of the stories, do not
distinguish between highly creative applications of Propp's
morphology and simple rewrites of the sample stories. Qualitative
analysis of the stories is needed.</p>
<p>They do not account for the quality of the stories, or compare
stories written with and without using Propp's morphology.</p>
<p>They do not measure learning, no comparison of stories written
before and after using Propp's morphology. Did the children
appropriate Proppian narrative concepts from their experience with
the tool?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Thesis Questions</dt>
<dd>
<p>So at this point in the research, where are we with respect to the
thesis questions?</p>
<p>Q1.
We have confirmed that Propp cards and story maps are a successful
representation of Propp's morphology for a story authoring tool.
These basic interface elements, along with observations about how
the children used them and what worked and what didn't, can now
feed into the design of a computer application that will further
answer Q1.</p>
<p>Q2.
We have shown that children can apply Propp's morphology to story
writing. They were able to grasp Propp's abstract narrative
concepts, such as the concept of function, and apply these concepts
to their own writing.</p>
<p>Q3.
We have not made much progress on Q3 yet, there has been no
comparison of stories written with and without using Propp's
morphology.</p>

<h3>The Story Maps Application</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Slide: Outline</dt>
<dd>
<p>Story Maps is a computer story authoring application that I
developed and evaluated for this PhD.</p>
<p>Its design is based on the exploratory study:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interpretation of Propp's morphology</li>
<li>The Propp cards and story maps</li>
<li>Observations of children's interaction with the Propp cards and
    story maps, what worked and what didn't</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements were drawn up, a prototype implemented and tested with
teachers and children, and then the final version implemented and
tested.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Planning View (1)</dt>
<dt>Slide: Planning View (2)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The planning view is the opening screen of Story Maps. You are
presented with a collection of story cards to choose from in the
green area at the top. You can inspect each card more closely by
moving the mouse cursor over a card to see it in more detail. You
drag-and-drop the story cards that you want to use and arrange them
into a story map in the grey area below. You can enter a title for
your story in the toolbar at the bottom of the window.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Propp Cards</dt>
<dd>
<p>Propp cards were created for each of Propp's functions.
Child-friendly texts for the cards were created based on our
interpretation of Propp and on feedback from teachers.
Illustrations were created by designer and illustrator Raymond Yuen,
based on the texts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Zooming</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each card has a title, short description, and longer description,
these are progressively revealed as the user 'zooms in' on the card.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Story Editor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clicking on the <em>Write your Story!</em> button brings up the story
editor.  With your story map in view above, you use the text editor
below to enter the text for your story. You have to fill in a part
of your story for each story card in your story map. If you change
your mind about one of the cards in your story map, you can go back
to the planning view at any time by clicking the <em>Go back to
planning</em> button.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Saving &amp; Opening</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can save your story map to file and open a saved story map to
continue working on it later.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Export &amp; Print</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can export your story to HTML or print it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Logging</dt>
<dd>
<p>The application automatically saves your story and keeps a log.</p>

<h3>Experimental Study</h3>

<dd>...</dd>
<dt>Slide: Experiment</dt>
<dd>...</dd>
<dt>Slide: Research Question</dt>
<dd>...</dd>
<dt>Slide: Hypotheses</dt>
<dd>
<p>The expectation was that using the story maps application would
improve some aspects of the stories written but not other aspects:</p>
<p>We expected the plot structure of the stories to improve. Story Maps
should encourage stories to have a clear build up, precipitating
event, protagonist's goal, action and resolution, because this plot
structure is embedded in the Propp cards and their sequence.</p>
<p>We expected character roles to improve. Story Maps should encourage
stories to contain characters that act in clear and consistent
roles, such as protagonist and antagonist, because these roles are
embodied by the spheres of action contained in Propp's functions.</p>
<p>We expected the coherence of the stories to improve, because the
Propp cards embody a logically and artistically sound sequence and
flow of events.</p>
<p>We did <em>not</em> expect the story maps application to affect the
description of characters or settings and their attributes or of
emotions because characters, settings and their attributes are not
represented as first-class objects in the application.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Research Design</dt>
<dd>
<p>The study used a pre-test post-test with control group research
design. Each participant wrote three stories during the study, at
pre-test, control or treatment condition and post-test.</p>
<p>For the pre-test all participants wrote stories using "crib sheet"
that was created with the help of a teacher.</p>
<p>Each participant was then randomly assigned to either the treatment
group or the control group. Treatment group participants created
stories using the story maps application, while the control group
participants used a typical classroom story planner.</p>
<p>Finally, all participants wrote a third story for post-test, using
the same crib sheet as in the pre-test.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Pre-test</dt>
<dd>
<p>For the pre-test participants read a "crib sheet" of questions to
keep in mind before writing their stories. On the back of the crib
sheet were some story titles to help with ideas.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>For the treatment participants were given a 15-minute introduction
to the story maps application and the narrative concepts it uses.
They then used the application to plan their stories in the
computers. Participants printed out their completed story maps, and
used these to write their stories on paper.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Control</dt>
<dd>
<p>For the control condition participants planned their stories using a
typical story planning framework, and then wrote them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Post-test</dt>
<dd>
<p>The post-test was the same as the pre-test, but the suggested story
titles on the back of the crib sheet were different.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Quantitative Measure of Narrative Structure</dt>
<dd>
<p>To analyse the stories a quantitative measure of narrative structure
was developed using an independent set of stories written by
children of the same age group.</p>
<p>The construct of <em>narrative structure</em> that was to be measured was
defined, the available procedures and tools were reviewed, and an
existing analytic rating scale was selected. This scale was trialed
on an independent set of real-world data and problems were found, so
the scale was significantly improved based on the trial data. An
inter-rater reliability test of the improved scale was carried out,
with good results.</p>
<p>The measure contains 11 scales such as the one shown, each measuring
a different criteria. It records whether or not the story has a
protagonist and antagonist, major and minor settings, a
precipitating event and some causal build-up to the precipitating
event, whether the protagonist has a goal and initiates actions in
order to achieve the goal, whether the story has a resolution, and a
few further details. Each scale is simple and unidimensional, the
levels are clearly defined, and empirical examples from the trial
data exemplify each level.</p>
<p>This scale can tell us both <em>whether</em> and <em>in what ways</em> two sets of
stories differ; it is reasonably quick to apply and can be used by
non-experts; it is reliable; it is valid (it ticks all of the boxes
on our defined construct of narrative structure); and it is more
sensitive than other available quantitative measures.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Quantitative Results</dt>
<dd>
<p>We found that the story maps application did improve the narrative
structure of the stories in some of the ways that we expected, but
for some aspects of narrative structure there was no room for
improvement. Specifically, Story Maps increased the incidence of
stories that contained an antagonist and increased the causal
complexity of story events leading up to the precipitating event.</p>
<p>But these conclusions must be qualified. First, due to an unexpected
difference between the control and treatment groups <em>at pre-test</em>,
the rival hypothesis of regression toward the mean cannot be
strongly refuted on the basis of the quantitative data. Second,
insufficient evidence was found to conclude that any effect was
retained at post-test.</p>
<p>As expected, we found no evidence that the story maps application
affected descriptions or emotions in the stories.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Thesis Questions</dt>
<dd>
<p>Where does this leave is with respect to the thesis questions?</p>
<ol>
<li>The Story Maps application has been developed and tested in
formative usability studies and in empirical studies of children's
story authoring in school settings. The application is a successful
representation of Propp's morphology in a story authoring tool for
children.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Story Maps application has limitations, including a lack of
support for descriptions of characters and settings, and that only
the most fundamental concepts from Propp's morphology are
represented.</p>
<ol>
<li>The exploratory and experimental studies show that children can
apply Propp's morphology to story writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, only the most basic concepts from Propp have been studied.</p>
<ol>
<li>The experimental study has compared stories written using a story
authoring tool based on Propp's morphology to stories written using
a typical story planner, and shown (with qualifications) that
certain aspects of the narrative structures of the stories were
improved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further qualitative analysis could tell us more about the quality of
the stories, and abut how children have used Propp's concepts in
their stories.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Further Work</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Slide: Outline</dt>
<dd>...</dd>
<dt>Slide: Further Work (1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Several areas for further work have been identified, including:</p>
<p>Qualitative analysis of the stories, using Propp's morphology.
Stories would first be broken down into their Proppian components,
and then systematic description would proceed from this analysis.
Children's stories could be compared to each other and to
traditional tales. The aim is a rich description of <em>how</em> children
have made use of Propp's morphology in their stories, what they can
do with it.</p>
<p>Further formalisation of Propp's morphology.</p>
<p>Integrating more of Propp's concepts into the Story Maps
application, enriching the model of narrative structure embodied by
the application.</p>
<p>Longer-term study of children's acquisition of fairy-tale narrative
structure through Propp's morphology. Both quantitative and
qualitative analysis would be used. Pre-test post-test with control
group, but with an intervention several sessions long. The aim is to
show learning, to show a significant effect at post-test.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Slide: Further Work(2)</dt>
<dd>
<p>An agenda for further study could be as follows:</p>
<p>Take one narrative concept from Propp's morphology at a time.</p>
<p>Carry out formative studies to find out how to formalise the
concept, and how to integrate it into a story authoring application.</p>
<p>The result of these formative studies would be a new version of the
story maps application with an additional narrative concept
represented.</p>
<p>This new version of the story authoring application could then be
used in experimental studies of children's story authoring. Can
children acquire the new narrative concept and apply it
successfully? If so, how do they use the new concept in their
stories?</p>
<p>You would then take the next narrative concept from Propp's
morphology and begin the cycle again.</p>
