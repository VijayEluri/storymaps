# Thesis Presentation: Children's Story Authoring with Propp's Morphology

The presentation should be a 'best bits' of the thesis: take the
argument and structure of the thesis, condense it into the key points,
put it in presentation format, back the points up with the best examples
from the thesis. May improve on the thesis with new visuals and new
examples (particularly excerpts from stories dug up from my data).

The presentation should also highlight difficulties, try to anticipate
criticisms, discuss decisions that were made and not made, lessons
learned.

## Introduction (5 mins)

-	Slide: Thesis title and my name
	*	Introduce yourself

Get their attention early on with a couple of eye-grabbing slides, and
_then_ outline the purpose and structure of the presentation:

-	Slide: Story Maps screenshot & URL
	*	Designed a story authoring tool for children

-	Slide: some visualisation of Propp's Morphology
	*	Based on a classic model of fairy tale narrative structure

-	Slide: some visualisation of one of my school studies
	*	Evaluated the tool in usability studies and in empirical studies of
		children's story writing in schools.
	*	Found that children were able to use the tool to plan and write
		original stories.

-	Slide:
	*	Through using the tool they grasped
		abstract narrative concepts and applied them to their own story
		writing.
	*	Using the tool improved some aspects of the stories written by
		the children.
	*	Children enjoyed using the tool and said that they found it
		helpful to their story writing.

-	Slide:
	*	Purpose of presentation: to give an overview of the thesis work,
		its central ideas, and the further work it identifies.

## Body (30 mins)

### Interactive Narrative in Education (motivation, 5 mins)

*	Show some existing school writing materials, point out their
	weaknesses. Motivate computer-based interactive narrative tools.

	Slide: pretest & posttest crib sheet
	Slide: control group planner
	Slides: Collingwood and/or Maddistion story planners

*	Show some existing tools, visualise their narrative structures.

	Slide: Adventure Author
	Slide: Script Cards

	These tools lack an overall model of narrative to bring together all
	of the components of a story into a coherent whole. It is the role
	of each component with respect to the narrative as a whole that
	makes a narrative structurally complete and well formed.
	
*	Give examples of what I mean by 'structurally complete and
	well-formed' from Favat [p.69]
	Maybe have a slide with a plot synopsis of a tale and point out each
	of these features. These are medium-independent features of
	narrative itself, as opposed to features of computer-based
	interactive narrative as a medium.
	-	Beginning, middle and end.
	-	Conflict and resolution.
	-	Characters acting in clear and consistent roles.
	-	Characters actions are motivated.
	-	Logical relationships between the events in a tale, each event has
		a role to play in the tale as a whole and each event articulates
		precisely with the other events in the tale: being sent to the
		well enables the youngest daughter to meet the poor woman, which
		enables the poor woman to test the daughter, which enables her
		to respond, and so on.
	-	Aesthetic relations, patterned contrastive repetitions at
		multiple levels: the good young daughter goes to the well and
		returns with the gift of flowers and jewels, the evil daughter
		goes the well and returns with the curse of snakes and toads.
	-	The moral order encoded in the structure of the tale: the
		essential goodness of the younger daughter is rewarded, the
		essential wickedness of the elder daugher is punished.

*	Want a high-level model of narrative that embodies knowledge about
	the overall structure of a narrative and the purpose of components such
	as characters, actions and motivations within the whole.

### Propp's morphology (the argument/hypothesis, 5 mins)



Russian folklorist Vladimir Propp (slide with photo), studied Russian
fairy tales collected by Afanas'ev (slide with photo of Afanas'ev or of
the volume).

He aimed to decompose tales into their component parts and study the
relationsips of these components to each other and to the whole,
producing an abstract compositional scheme of the fairy tales.

-	Slide: Propp function example.
-	Slide: Function: "an act of a character, defined from the point of
	view of its significance for the course of action."

Propp broke up plots into their constituent "functions": example from
NILE 2009 presentation. A function of a plot event abstracted and
defined from the point of view of its significance for the course of
action. The abstract plot functions are the same across many tales, but
the concrete details of how they are realised vary.

Slide: Propp identified 31 functions that he claimed accounted for the
plots of thousands of Russian fairy tales. Not every story contains
every function, the functions always occur in the same order, no
function excludes another.

Slide: "this explains the two-fold quality of the tale: its amazing multiformity, picturesqueness, and color, and on the other hand, its no less striking uniformity, its repetition."

Slide: character roles defined by their "spheres of action".

Slide: there are many other elements also.

Slide: these functions and roles can be seen as building blocks with
which to construct new plots, and then fill in the concrete details for
each block.

*	Expand on how Propp's morphology could be useful, make the argument
	for it.

	Using existing interactive narrative tools you could tell the
	children to make stories with a beginning, middle and end, a
	conflict and resolution, well-motivated characters, etc., but the
	tool itself doesn't give them any help with this. These tools
	contain representations of branching plot etc., but don't actually
	contain any support for the kind of narrative concepts that teachers
	are trying to teach with their story writing crib sheets and
	worksheets. In that sense it's no different than a piece of paper of
	a word processor: you can tell them to apply concepts of good
	narrative structure, but the word processor doesn't really help them
	with it. We want a story making tool that actually _embodies_
	abstract narrative concepts.

*	Thesis Questions:

	1.	How can Propp's morphology be represented in a story authoring
		tool for children?
	2.	Can children apply Propp's morphology to story writing?
	3.	Does using Propp's morphology affect the quality of the stories
		written by children? If so, in what ways?
	
	Children = 7-11 year-olds.

### Exploratory Study (5 mins)

-	Slide:
	A two-week exploratory study that was carried out in an English
	primary school, in which 42 participants aged 7-11 created stories
	using paper 'Propp cards' and 'story maps'.
-	Slide: image of a Propp card
-	Slide: photo of a story map
-	Slide: Research Question
	Can children use Propp cards and story maps to write stories that
	realise the Proppian narrative concepts that the Propp cards and
	story maps aim to represent?
-	Slide: Procedures, Week One
	One-two hour story writing sessions with 5 participants in each.
	Enumerated list of session procedures.
-	Slide: Procedures, Week Two
-	Slide: Quantitative Results
-	Slide: Formalised Propp's morphology for story analysis.
-	Slide(s):
	The quantitative results show that children were successful at
	writing stories that manifested the Proppian narrative structures
	represented by the story maps. Using story maps children were able
	to manifest the right Propp functions in the right order in their
	stories. Children are able to grasp Propp's abstract concepts of
	function and role and apply them to their own original story
	writing. So Propp's morphology is a usable model of narrative for a
	children's story authoring tool, and Propp cards and story maps are
	a successful representation of Propp's morphology.
-	Slide: limitations of the quantitative results.
	-	Concerned with functions only
	-	Don't account for originality
	-	Don't account for quality
	-	Don't measure learning
-	Slide(s):
	Observations to inform the design of the computer application.
-	Slide(s):
	Observations about how Propp cards and story maps affect children's
	writing, generating hypothesis for future studies.
-	Slide: Thesis Questions

### Story Maps Application (5 mins)

Show a series of screenshots, and give the application URL.

Briefly mention the process by which the application was developed.

See my interview notes.

### Experimental Study (5 mins)

-	Slide:
	A three-week experimental study that compared stories written using
	the story maps application to stories written using a typical
	classroom story planning worksheet. Carried out in an English
	primary school. 40 participants aged 8-11.
-	Slide: Research Question
	Does using the story maps application improve the narrative
	structure of the stories written? If so, in what ways?
-	Slide: Hypotheses
-	Slide: Research Design
	Pretest, posttest, control group.
	Each participant wrote three stories.
-	Slide(s): Procedures
-	Slide: prestest and posttest instruction sheet
-	Slide: control group story planner
-	Quantitative Results
	-	Slide: Quantitative Measure of Narrative Structure
	-	Plot structure and character roles
	-	Characters and their attributes
	-	Settings and their attributes
	-	Details of the action
	-	Goals of the protagonist
	-	Resolution and conclusion
	-	Emotions
	-	Coherence
-	Slide: Feedback from Participants
-	Slide: Thesis Questions

### Further Work (5 mins)

Slide: Outline

Slide: Further Work (1)
	Qualitative analysis using Propp's morphology. A story would first
	be broken down into its Proppian structural components, and a
	systematic qualitative description of the story would proceed from
	this decomposition. Compare children's stories to each other, and to
	traditional tales. Not whether or not participants have applied
	Propp but _how_ they have used it in their stories.
