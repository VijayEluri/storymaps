Story Maps is a prototype story writing tool for children, that I
created as a research tool for my PhD. It is based on ideas from
_The Morphology of the Folktale_ by Vladimir Propp and _The Grammar
of Fantasy_ by Gianni Rodari. For more info see the publications on
my website.

You can download the source from github, but the easiest way to try
out the application is by launching it directly from its web page:
