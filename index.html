<h2>StoryMaps</h2>

<p>StoryMaps is a free story planning and writing application for children that
works on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X or Linux. I created StoryMaps for
<a href="http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/5294">my PhD</a>,
and worked with teachers, children, creative writing experts and an illustrator
to design and evaluate it.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This short video introduces StoryMaps and shows you how to use it:</p>

<div class="flowplayer is-splash minimalist"

  <video src="screencast_collingwood.mp4"></video>
</div>

<p>StoryMaps breaks down the elements of traditional fairy tales into building
blocks which children can use to invent new stories. With StoryMaps children
can create stories that contain their own original ideas while being
structurally complete and well-formed. I hope that StoryMaps will give children
a powerful mental model for understanding stories and their construction.
School trials of StoryMaps found that through using the application children
were able to grasp abstract narrative concepts and apply them to their own
writing, and that the experience improved the narrative structure of children's
stories.</p>

<p>You can read more about StoryMaps, the ideas behind
it and how it was developed and evaluated with teachers and children in these
publications:</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<div class="overview">

<img src="scrot2.png" title="The planning view" alt="The planning view">

<p>The <b>planning view</b> is the opening screen of StoryMaps.  You are
presented with a collection of story cards to choose from in the green area at
the top. You can inspect each card more closely by moving the mouse cursor over
a card to see it in more detail. You drag-and-drop the story cards that you
want to use and arrange them into a <b>story map</b> in the grey area below.
You can enter a title for your story in the toolbar at the bottom of the
window.</p>

<img src="cards.png" title="Some story cards" alt="Some story cards">

<p>The <b>story cards</b> are based on plot functions from Vladimir Propp's
study of traditional Russian fairy tales,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Morphology-Folktale-Publications-American-Folklore/dp/0292783760">
Morphology of the Folktale</a>. They were illustrated by
<a href="http://rayuen.com/">designer and illustrator Raymond Yuen</a>.</p>

<img src="zoom.png" title="A story card at three levels of detail"
     alt="A story card at three levels of detail">

<p>Move the mouse pointer over a story card to see it in more detail, and open
the story editor to see even more detail about the story cards.</p>

<img src="scrot3.png" title="The story editor" alt="The story editor">

<p>Clicking on the <i>Write your Story!</i> button brings up the <b>story
  editor</b>. With your story map in view above, you use the text editor below
to enter the text for your story. You have to fill in a part of your story for
each story card in your story map. If you change your mind about one of the
cards in your story map, you can go back to the planning view at any time by
clicking the <i>Go back to planning</i> button.</p>

<img src="scrot4.png" title="The File menu" alt="The File menu">

<p>You can <i>save your story map</i> to file and <i>open a saved story map</i>
to continue working on it later.</p>

<img src="scrot5.png" title="The preview window" alt="The preview window">

<p>When you've finished writing you can <i>preview your story</i> and <i>export
  it to HTML</i>, or <i>print</i> it.</p>

<img src="scrot6.png" title="Automatically saved story maps" alt="Automatically saved story maps">

<p>Forgot to press save? StoryMaps automatically saves your story as you work
on it. You'll find automatically saved stories in the <i>StoryMaps</i> folder
in your home directory (on Linux) or in your My Documents folder (on Windows).
You can open automatically saved stories using the <i>Open a Saved Story</i>
button in the <i>File</i> menu in the StoryMaps window.</p>
