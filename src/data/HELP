At the top is the collection of story cards that you can use for
your story. You can zoom in to take a closer look at a card by
double-clicking on it (right-click to zoom back out again).

Choose the story cards that you want to use in your story, drag them
onto your story map below, and arrange them in the order that you
want. If you change your mind about a card, you can always drag it
back to where it came from.

When you're ready to do some writing click on the button at the
bottom. An editor will appear where you can enter the title of your
story, and the text for each card in the story. You can still re-
arrange the cards in your story map while you have the editor open.

You can hide the editor again at any time and go back to adding
story cards to your map and removing cards from your map. If you
open the editor again, any text you've already written will still be
there.

If you remove a card from your story map you can later drag the same
card back again, and any text that you had written for that card
will reappear in your story.
